**1. Provide Store Domain**
You need to provide your store domain to the UseePay operations team. The domain format should be xxx.myshopline.com. After provision, wait for the UseePay operations team to complete the configuration before proceeding to install Apple Pay/Google Pay; otherwise, they will not be searchable.
